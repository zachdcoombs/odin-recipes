    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Simple to make, just dip and bake! Garlicky goodness 
        in a breaded chicken dish. Yum!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup italian-seasoning bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan over 
            low heat until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer garlic and oil to a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in a separate shallow bowl</li>
        <li>Dip chicken breasts in the olive oil-garlic mixture using tongs; transfer 
            to bread crumb mixture and turn to evenly coat. Transfer coated chicken 
            to a shallow baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, 30 
            to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
            read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
